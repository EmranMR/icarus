Icarus provides first-class language support for **Swift**, **C**, **C++**, and **Objective-C**.

If you are Swift or C-family language developer, Icarus can provide you with first-class support for building client- and server-side applications and frameworks.

‚ú® Fun fact: This extension's debugging support was built entirely using Nova and Icarus. _"Look ma, no Xcode!"_

## Features

Icarus adds:

- üñçÔ∏è **Syntax highlighting**, symbolication, and code folding using Tree-sitter grammars
- üß™ **Language intelligence**, completions, issues, and more via SourceKit-LSP
- üêõ **Debugging** via LLDB

Intelligence is provided using [SourceKit-LSP](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp) from the Swift open-source project. This language server provides support for Swift natively and uses `clangd` behind the scenes for C-family languages.

Debugging is supported using _LLDB.framework_, distributed with Apple's Xcode tools and the Swift compiler toolchain.

## Requirements

Syntax highlighting, symbolication, and code folding for all supported languages are included out of the box.

For language intelligence, completions, and debugging, a Swift toolchain is required (even if you are just working with C-family languages, as the toolchain provides support for everything).

- If you already have Apple's Xcode app in your `/Applications` folder, there should be nothing else you'll need to do.
- Otherwise, the easiest way to get started is to download Apple's Xcode command-line tools using `xcode-select --install`.
- Alternatively, you can install a [development version of the Swift toolchain](https://www.swift.org/download/) and select it for use in the extension preferences.

## C / C++ and Compile Commands

Projects utilizing the C or C++ languages may need to provide a `compile_commands.json` file in the project root for some language features to work. This file can be generated by most common build systems, including CMake. For more information, [check out the Clang documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html).

## Building, Running, and Debugging Your Project

To build and run your project, you will want to create a Task in Nova's tasks interface. Follow these steps for a quick way to get up and running:

1. Open your project settings by clicking your project name in the toolbar.
2. Next to "Tasks" in the settings list, click the plus button and choose **LLDB Debug** to add a new debugging task.
    - Name your task something descriptive if you'd like, such as the name of your built target, its configuration, etc.
3. Click the disclosure triangle beside your task to expand out the Pipeline options
4. In the "Build" section, add one or more custom script steps to tell Nova how to interface with your build system.
5. In the main options for the task, set the Executable to the built path of your target.

For the Build pipeline step(s), it should just be a matter of adding the appropriate shell commands to a Build pipeline step to invoke and compile your target or product in the same way you'd build in a terminal.
